# Prework-Study-Guide

## A study guide for prework bootcamp
This is a prework study guide that I am testing how github works!

## Description

In creating this, I was introduced and learned how to use JavaScript, HTML, and CSS

This also allows a place where I can save notes on the three languages if I wanted to reference back to
Or if anyone else wanted to see what notes I took to help them out as well.


I created it in order to certain functions such as:
-How to use .html and open it in a browser
-How to use .css to style our webpage 
-How to use .js to send info to the user via the console log
-How to commit our changes, and merge them into main

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

Open up the index.html file in Google Chrome
Alternatively, you can open it using VSCode and then type: Alt + B and this will open in your default browser

You can view the notes that I took form this page

Also, there is information about what topics we learned about in the console log. To access press F12 and press on Console
Alternatively you can right-click and select "Inspect"

Every time you refresh the page it will list the topics, and select a random one to study
